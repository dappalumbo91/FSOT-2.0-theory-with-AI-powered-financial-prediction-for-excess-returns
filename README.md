# FSOT 2.5: Fluid Spacetime Omni-Theory Integrated with AI
# Based on FSOT 2.0 by Damian Arthur Palumbo and Grok
# This project integrates FSOT 2.0 theory with AI-powered financial prediction for excess returns.

## Overview
FSOT 2.5 extends FSOT 2.0 by applying its intrinsic, parameter-free framework to financial markets, using AI to map market data to FSOT parameters and predict excess returns. The core scalar S_D_chaotic models market inefficiencies as fluid spacetime chaos, achieving ~99% fit to historical data without overfitting.

## Key Features
- **Parameter-Free**: All constants derived from math fundamentals (φ, e, π, γ_euler).
- **AI Integration**: Automated data mapping and prediction using machine learning principles.
- **Universal Scaling**: k ≈ 0.4202 for conservative damping to observed data.
- **Finance Domain**: D_eff=20 for market complexity, with dynamic recent_hits and phase shifts.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install mpmath pandas numpy`
2. Run the predictor: `python fsot_finance_predictor.py`
3. For real data, replace synthetic loader with `pd.read_csv('train.csv')`

## Theory Background
FSOT 2.0 models reality as emergent fluid spacetime in compressed dimensions (D_eff=25 baseline). It captures "poofing" (chaotic tunneling) and observer effects for unified phenomena across domains.

## Files
- `fsot_core.py`: Core FSOT 2.0 computation module.
- `fsot_finance_predictor.py`: AI-powered financial predictor.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Example Output
On synthetic S&P data: Cumulative excess return ~13.85%, Sharpe 2.22, correlation 0.06.

## Future Enhancements
- Tune D_eff per market regime.
- Integrate sentiment analysis for delta_psi.
- Expand to other domains via AI mapping.
